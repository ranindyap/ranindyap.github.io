<h1> "Nanin" </h1>
<p align="justify">My nickname, created by my dad's <i>creative</i> brain with no intentional meaning.
    Out of curiosity (and denial of having "meaningless" name) I googled it and I found this: </p>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align:center">
            <b> Ñāṇin </b>, (adj.) knowing, <b><i>one who is possessed of (right) knowledge </i></b> S. II, 169; A. II,

    So... by sheer luck, it has a good meaning :)</p>

<h1> Overview </h1>
<p align="justify">I'm currently pursuing my PhD at the <a href="https://iecs.unitn.it/">University of Trento,
        Italy</a>, focusing on
    software security under the supervision of <a href="https://fabiomassacci.github.io/">Prof. Fabio Massacci</a>. My
    interest on this field started when I was doing my bachelor in informatics, at <a
        href="https://www.itb.ac.id/">Institut
        Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia</a>. I continued my master on the same field, doing my thesis on <a
        href="https://doi.org/10.1109/icodse53690.2021.9648484">mining software repositories for security</a>. </p>
<p align="justify">I'm grateful that until now, all my higher education years are covered by <a
        href="/cv/#certificates-and-awards">several
        scholarships</a>. During my bachelor and master periods, I had <a href="/cv/#work-experiences">several
        internship
        experiences</a> in some software companies in Indonesia. Despite having some experiences working in industry, I
    discovered that I enjoy teaching and (later) <a href="/publications">researching</a>, which encouraged me to pursue
    my
    PhD. I also enjoy attending <a href="/cv/#conferences-and-events">conferences/ schools</a> as they broaden my
    knowledge
    while giving me networking opportunity. </p>
