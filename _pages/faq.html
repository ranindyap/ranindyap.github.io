<h1>FAQ</h1>
This is <i>kinda</i> a <b>secret page</b>, which contains several FAQs about me.

<h2> How can you start your PhD when you are only <b>21</b>? </h2>
This is the <b>most frequently</b> asked question. <br>
The short answer is <b><i>"I skipped 3 years."</i></b> <br>
But I also have the long one. So if I referred you here, maybe I was not in the best condition to explain it properly to
you, sorry about that.
Ok, no more stalling, let me start. <br>
First, <b>"How Education Works in Indonesia"</b>: <br>
<ul>
    <li>Kids start elementary school at the age of 6 (back then in 2005, with the minimum of 5.5 y.o.) or 7 (<a
            href="https://ditpsd.kemdikbud.go.id/artikel/detail/penerimaan-peserta-didik-baru-ppdb-jenjang-sekolah-dasar">new
            law by The Ministry of Education in 2021</a>, with the minimum of 6.5 y.o.).</li>
    <li>Elementary school (primary education) takes 6 years. (6-12 y.o.)</li>
    <li>Junior high school takes 3 years. (12-15 y.o.)</li>
    <li>High school takes 3 years. (15-18 y.o.)</li>
    <li>Bachelor's degree takes 3-4 years depending on the major, for engineering mostly takes 4 years. (18-22 y.o)</li>
    <li>Master's degree takes 2 years. (22-24 y.o.)</li>
</ul>
Now you are annoyed, "Nanin, you don't answer the question!".
Well, I need to explain that to make sure everyone first gets how's the common education system in Indonesia,
as I now realize that this is not the same in all countries. <br>
Now, the real thing, <b>"How was <i>Mine</i></b>: <br>
<ul>
    <li>I started elementary school at the age of 5.5 y.o, which I will round-down to 5 for simplicity.
        <b><i>(-1)</i></b>
    </li>
    <li>Elementary school (primary education) takes 6 years. (5-11 y.o.)</li>
    <li>Junior high school takes 3 years. (11-14 y.o.)</li>
    <li>High school takes only <b>2</b> years, because I took an acceleration program (this is legal). (14-16 y.o.)
        <b><i>(-1)</i></b>
    </li>
    <li>Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://stei.itb.ac.id/en/home/">Informatics Engineering at Institut Teknologi
            Bandung, Indonesia</a> takes 4 years. (16-20 y.o)</li>
    <li>Master's degree takes <b>1</b> year. This is not completely true, because technically, I started my Master's on
        my <b>last</b> year of Bachelor (1 year overlapping), which is allowed by the <a
            href="https://stei.itb.ac.id/iso/sop-stei-akd-11/">FastTrack program.</a> (19-21 y.o.) <b><i>(-1)</i></b>
    </li>
</ul>
Which then I get the total of -3 years from the common education path, 24 - 3 = 21 y.o., and I directly started my PhD
after I finished my Master's.
