<h1>FAQ</h1>
This is <i>kinda</i> a <b>secret page</b>, which contains several FAQs about me.

<h2>How can you start your PhD when you are only <b>21</b>? </h2>
This is the <b>most frequently</b> asked question. <br>
The short answer is <b><i>"I skipped 3 years."</i></b> <br>
<p align="justify">But I also have the long one. So if I referred you here, maybe I was not in the best condition to
    explain it properly to
    you, sorry about that.
    Ok, no more stalling, let me start. </p> <br>
First, <b>"How Education Works in Indonesia"</b>: <br>
<ul>
    <li>Kids start elementary school at the age of 6 (back then in 2005, with the minimum of 5.5 y.o.) or 7 (<a
            href="https://ditpsd.kemdikbud.go.id/artikel/detail/penerimaan-peserta-didik-baru-ppdb-jenjang-sekolah-dasar">new
            law by The Ministry of Education in 2021</a>, with the minimum of 6.5 y.o.).</li>
    <li>Elementary school (primary education) takes 6 years. (6-12 y.o.)</li>
    <li>Junior high school takes 3 years. (12-15 y.o.)</li>
    <li>High school takes 3 years. (15-18 y.o.)</li>
    <li>Bachelor's degree takes 3-4 years depending on the major, for engineering mostly takes 4 years. (18-22 y.o)</li>
    <li>Master's degree takes 2 years. (22-24 y.o.)</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Now you are annoyed, "Nanin, you don't answer the question!".
    Well, I need to explain that to make sure everyone first gets how's the common education system in Indonesia,
    as I now realize that this is not the same in all countries. <br> </p>
Now, the real thing, <b>"How was <i>Mine</i></b>: <br>
<ul>
    <li>I started elementary school at the age of 5.5 y.o, which I will round-down to 5 for simplicity.
        <b><i>(-1)</i></b>
    </li>
    <li>Elementary school (primary education) takes 6 years. (5-11 y.o.)</li>
    <li>Junior high school takes 3 years. (11-14 y.o.)</li>
    <li>High school takes only <b>2</b> years, because I took an acceleration program (this is legal). (14-16 y.o.)
        <b><i>(-1)</i></b>
    </li>
    <li>Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://stei.itb.ac.id/en/home/">Informatics Engineering at Institut Teknologi
            Bandung, Indonesia</a> takes 4 years. (16-20 y.o)</li>
    <li>Master's degree takes <b>1</b> year. This is not completely true, because technically, I started my Master's on
        my <b>last</b> year of Bachelor (1 year overlapping), which is allowed by the <a
            href="https://stei.itb.ac.id/iso/sop-stei-akd-11/">FastTrack program.</a> (19-21 y.o.) <b><i>(-1)</i></b>
    </li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Which then I get the total of -3 years from the common education path, 24 - 3 = 21 y.o., and I
    directly started my PhD
    after I finished my Master's.</p>

<h2>Where does "Nanin" come from? </h2>
<p align="justify">It comes from on top of my dad's <i>creative</i> mind, which I concluded has no meaning.
    Why? Because <i>every single time</i> I asked the meaning of it, his answer <i>changes</i>.
    However, out of curiosity (and denial of having a "meaningless" name) I googled it and I found this: </p>
<p style="padding:10px 0px; border-style: double;" align="center"><b>Ñāṇin</b>, (adj.) knowing, <b><i>one who is
            possessed of (right)
            knowledge </i></b><small>S. II, 169; A. II, 89 (sammā°); IV, 340 </small> </p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://dictionary.sutta.org/">Sutta: The Pali Text Society's Pali-English Dictionary]</a> <br />
    So... by sheer luck, it has a good meaning :)</p>

<h2>How did you end up in Italy? or Why do you choose Italy?</h2>
<p align="justify">On my last year of Master's, I told my supervisor: "I think I want to do a PhD, do you have any
    recommendations? Any university... professor?".
    He answered, "Have you ever looked up for <b>Fabio Massacci</b>? If you haven't, you should." This particular name
    he mentioned turns out to be his supervisor when he did his PhD years ago.
    Then I googled it, found out that Fabio is working in the
    <a href="">University of Trento, Italy</a> and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I looked for the
    application procedures for both, and turned out there was a PhD call
    at the University of Trento at that time. I applied there on exactly the deadline day (Aug 31st), but I also emailed
    Fabio directly for the position in VU (according to the procedure in their website).
    Exactly one month after that (Oct 1st), I got the acceptance notification.
