# FAQ
This is *kinda* a **secret page**, which contains several FAQs about me.

## How can you start your PhD when you are only **21**? 
This is the **most frequently** asked question. <br>
The short answer is ***"I skipped 3 years."*** <br>
But I also have the long one. So if I referred you here, maybe I was not in the best condition to
    explain it properly to
    you, sorry about that.
    Ok, no more stalling, let me start. <br>
First, **"How Education Works in Indonesia"**: <br>
- Kids start elementary school at the age of 6 (back then in 2005, with the minimum of 5.5 y.o.) or 7 ([new
            law by The Ministry of Education in 2021](https://ditpsd.kemdikbud.go.id/artikel/detail/penerimaan-peserta-didik-baru-ppdb-jenjang-sekolah-dasar), with the minimum of 6.5 y.o.).
- Elementary school (primary education) takes 6 years. (6-12 y.o.)
- Junior high school takes 3 years. (12-15 y.o.)
- High school takes 3 years. (15-18 y.o.)
- Bachelor's degree takes 3-4 years depending on the major, for engineering mostly takes 4 years. (18-22 y.o)
- Master's degree takes 2 years. (22-24 y.o.)
Now you are annoyed, "Nanin, you don't answer the question!".
    Well, I need to explain that to make sure everyone first gets how's the common education system in Indonesia,
    as I now realize that this is not the same in all countries. <br>
Now, the real thing, **"How was *Mine***: <br>
- I started elementary school at the age of 5.5 y.o, which I will round-down to 5 for simplicity. ***(-1)***
- Elementary school (primary education) takes 6 years. (5-11 y.o.)
- Junior high school takes 3 years. (11-14 y.o.)
- High school takes only **2** years, because I took an acceleration program (this is legal). (14-16 y.o.) ***(-1)***
    
- Bachelor's degree in [Informatics Engineering at Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia](https://stei.itb.ac.id/en/home/) takes 4 years. (16-20 y.o)
- Master's degree takes **1** year. This is not completely true, because technically, I started my Master's on
        my **last** year of Bachelor (1 year overlapping), which is allowed by the [FastTrack program.](https://stei.itb.ac.id/iso/sop-stei-akd-11/) (19-21 y.o.) ***(-1)***
    
Which then I get the total of -3 years from the common education path, 24 - 3 = 21 y.o., and I
    directly started my PhD
    after I finished my Master's.

## Where does "Nanin" come from? 
It comes from on top of my dad's *creative* mind, which I concluded has no meaning.
    Why? Because *every single time* I asked the meaning of it, his answer *changes*.
    However, out of curiosity (and denial of having a "meaningless" name) I googled it and I found this:
<p style="padding:10px 0px; border-style: double;" align="center"><b>Ñāṇin</b>, (adj.) knowing, <i><b>one who is possessed of (right) knowledge </b></i><small>S. II, 169; A. II, 89 (sammā°); IV, 340 </small> </p>
Source: [Sutta: The Pali Text Society's Pali-English Dictionary](http://dictionary.sutta.org/) <br>
So... by sheer luck, it has a good meaning :)

## How did you end up in Italy? or Why do you choose Italy?
On my last year of Master's, I told my supervisor: "I think I want to do a PhD, do you have any
recommendations? Any university... professor?".
He answered, "Have you ever looked up for **Fabio Massacci**? If you haven't, you should." This particular name
he mentioned turns out to be his supervisor when he did his PhD years ago.
Then I googled it, found out that Fabio is working in the
[University of Trento, Italy](https://iecs.unitn.it/) and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I looked for the
application procedures for both, and turned out there was a PhD call
at the University of Trento at that time. I applied there on exactly the deadline day (Aug 31st), but I also emailed
Fabio directly for the position in VU (according to the procedure in their website).
Exactly one month after that (Oct 1st), I got the acceptance notification.
